In this project, I use Hartman-Orlin early termination of Karp's algorithm for a more efficient Min Cycle Mean calculation, as described in S. Maji and C.-K. Koh, “A Scalable, Memory-Efficient Algorithm for Minimum Cycle Mean Calculation in Directed Graphs,” 
IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, vol. 41, no. 6, pp. 1943–1956, Jun. 2022, doi: https://doi.org/10.1109/tcad.2021.3097300.

I also find the min mean cycle using a DFS-based approach.
